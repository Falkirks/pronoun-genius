> Neopronoun aggregation tool

This is a tool for aggregating English \[neo\]pronouns OTF or for storage in a cutesy little database. Pronouns are "discovered" from a list of websites using a regular expression (basically some hella wicked automagic). This could be used in a web application to allow users to pick cool pronouns for their profiles. It was developed for use in a future projects of mine to allow better user pronoun selection options.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save pronoun-genius
```


## Usage

```js
var pronounGenius = require('pronoun-genius');

pronounGenius.list(function(err, list){
  console.log(list);
  // the console has been overwhelmed by third person pronouns
});
```

```sh
$ npm install --global pronoun-genius
$ pronoun-genius --help
```

## Discovery algorithm 
genius can discover
